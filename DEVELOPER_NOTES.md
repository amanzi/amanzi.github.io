# Installation

This website is built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), a static site generator with Markdown-based websites and a rich ecosystem of plugins.

## Directory Overview

```sh
$ tree -L 1

```

## Installing Dependencies
##### Instructions sourced from [the Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#set-default-nodejs-version).

```sh
# Upgrade apt
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt -y upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install -y curl git

# Install NVM
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install 14
$ nvm use 14

# Check versions
$ nvm --version
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

## Installing Gatsby

```sh
$ npm install -g gatsby-cli
$ gatsby --version
$ gatsby --help
```

## Compiling the website
### Development Version

Gatsby has a development mode which allows for live previewing and change monitoring. To run,

```sh
$ gatsby develop
```

The console will show output similar to:

```txt
You can now view gatsby-starter-flex in the
browser.
⠀
  http://localhost:8000/
⠀
View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your
site's data and schema
⠀
  http://localhost:8000/___graphql
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view the website.

### Production Version

To build the production version, run:

```sh
$ gatsby build
```

Note that content **may not render correctly when viewing these built files locally**. This is due to how relative/absolute URLs are generated by Gatsby - viewing them on an actual web server is the best way to verify content, outside of `gatsby develop`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The configured [GitHub Action](./.github/gatsby_build.yml) should automatically deploy changes to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Developer Notes
### Rendering in VS Code

Visual Studio Code has a plugin called [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) which simplifies web development. After installing the plugin, open the packages pane (on Mac: `⌘ + shift + P`) and launch `Live Preview: Start Server`.

### Adding New Pages

Existing pages can be found under `./content/pages/`, and take the form `page-name/index.mdx`. MDX is an extension of Markdown with support for React.js components.

For more information, see:

- [MDX.js](https://mdxjs.com)
- [Gatsby Docs: Add components to content using MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/)

## Running

To test locally, run:

```
yarn install
```

to install any dependencies, and

```
gatsby develop
```

to launch the server.

A localhost server will be started with live updates as pages and components change.
The server must be restarted if `gatsby-config.js` changes.

If dependencies change, `yarn.lock` and `package.json` must have their updates pushed to the repo as well.

### Testing Deployment

To test how CI will behave, run

```
rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn install && yarn deploy
```

### Changing Repos

Before deploying to a web hosting service, the `pathPrefix` variable needs to be
updated relative to the deployed websites location.

I.e., for `https://amanzi.github.io/landing-page-test`, the `pathPrefix` will be `landing-page-test`.

For `https://amanzi.github.io/`, `pathPrefix` will be `/`.

This variable is located in `gatsby-config.js`.

## Developer Notes

### Adding Pages

Every Markdown file under `content/pages` will be compiled into a web page.
See other pages in that directory to get an idea of how these pages should be formatted.

An example page might be:

```
---
title: Example Markdown Page
excerpt: ok
---

<Section 
  heading="Example Markdown Page"
  lead="Tristique ipsum tempor eget"
>
<Div style={{
  maxWidth: ["none", "none", "60%"]
}}>

# Markdown Stuff

### Here, I can add Markdown components.

One should add images like this to take advantage of Gatsby features:

<Image src="placeholder.jpg" style={{mt: [4,8]}}/>

Though the regular syntax of `![alt](url)` will still work.

### Another Subsection

Remember to close the Div and Section blocks when you're done.
We have these to ensure consistent formatting (i.e., centering, body div width).

</Div>
</Section>
```

### Components

- Custom components are found under `src/*.js`, and the gallery component is found under `src/components/gallery.js`.
  - These components can be changed at will.
  - The theme components can be overridden: e.g., the [footer](https://github.com/arshad/gatsby-themes/blob/master/themes/gatsby-theme-flex/src/layout/footer.js)

### Theming

- This page is built off the Flex theme:
  - Theme source: https://github.com/arshad/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-flex
  - Sample page (rendered): https://flex.arshad.io
  - Sample page (source): https://github.com/arshad/gatsby-example-flex

- Uses Theme UI for color and component management
  - Documentation: https://theme-ui.com
  - Edit the `src/gatsby-theme-flex/theme.js` file to change/update theming

### Assets

- All assets (videos, BibTex files, etc) should go under `static`

### Images

- All images should go under `assets/images`, except those being used in a photo gallery.
- Photo gallery images go under `static/photo-gallery`.
- Photo gallery images will also need a thumbnail image to improve loading times.
  - Thumbnails can easily be created with the `mogrify` command:
      - `mogrify -resize 300 *.png`
      - Installed using `brew install imagemagick`

### Videos

Videos and video thumbnails are found under `static/video-gallery`.

- Videos must be in MP4 format
  - FFMPEG can be used for conversion:
    - `ffmpeg -i ${INPUT} -vcodec h264 -acodec mp2 -b:a 32k -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" ${EXPORT}`

- Videos require a thumbnail image as well
  - This is displayed when the video hasn't started loading yet
  - FFMPEG can also create thumbnail images:
    - This command can be used to easily create thumbnails:
      - `ffmpeg -i ${INPUT_VIDEO} -vf  "thumbnail" -frames:v 1 ${OUT_IMAGE}`

## Help

In general, this should be pretty straightforward to add new pages and edit
content.

However, Gatsby.js and React.js have some small "gotchas" for those not familiar
with them. Please open an issue or [email me](mailto:livingston@lanl.gov) if
you're having difficulties. 99 times of 100, the solution will be straightforward
yet hidden from those without intimate knowledge of React.
